## Reasons why we want to scrape into node

we can...

- make an API people can request from
- do things in an automated way
- save results into CSV files or a DB

## Finding details through dev tools

- F12 - shortkey for chrome dev tools
- find the identifiers and test out some initial script
  - then paste that simple script over to the IDE to flesh things out
- do the writes in the IDE, then paste over in browser to see how it works, it's faster than using chromium each time
